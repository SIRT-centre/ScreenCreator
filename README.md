# Screen Creator Plugin #

The Screen Creator plugin is used for generating walls for use with ICVFX workflows, nDisplay, game development, and other potential use cases

### Setup ###
The plugin will need to be built if downloaded from source. Place the plugin into a Unreal Engine C++ project. A Blueprint project can be converted into a C++ project by adding a new C++ file through the editor options **Tools > New C++ Class...** and using the default values.

Once the plugin is placed in to the project Plugins/ folder, run the project, and select yes at the prompt to rebuild the ScreenCreator plugin modules.

For detailed information on plugin usage, view the **Screen Creator - Documentation.pdf**.
